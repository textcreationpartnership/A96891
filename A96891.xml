            <title>A good souldier, maintaining his militia, and posturing himself, as the servants of the Lord, now and in all ages have postured the kingdomes; wherein the right-hand of the Lord with his servants directing their way, and blessing their worke; and all His ordinances, fasting, praying, preaching, &amp;c. unto the nation; is declared as mightily, as it was by the resurrection from the dead, whether we respect a nation or a man only. Here is a register of Gods blessings and Satans curses; a record of the (megaleia,) the great and admiral salvations, which God has wrought for the (Righteous) nation, and the man there: And of the terrible things Hee has done against His adversaries these foure last yeares. Humbly presented to the House of Parliament and Assembly of Divines. With a discovery of the loyall convert, that he is quite turned from his God, his King and his kingdome: a most disloyall person to all three.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:130910:7"/> quite <hi>naked,</hi> expoſed to all the <hi>malice</hi> of the Devill and his owne heart; what were it to him, that the Kingdome is ſet in a ſafe and good poſture, if in the meane time, he himſelf be, as a <hi>Towne without walls, or as a City whoſe walls are broken downe;</hi> who or what will may come-in, and goe-out, and make a prey there? Therefore I will point a few words directly to him, even that particular man, that lookes to have comfort, ſafety and peace in the Kingdomes ſafety. That is his <hi>hope,</hi> But there is an <hi>hope,</hi> which makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, like waters dried-up in ſummer: Is it a true <hi>hope?</hi> Then the man has this ground, That all this time, while the Kingdome has been <hi>posturing,</hi> he has, with the <hi>good ſouldier,</hi> learned well to poſture himſelfe; he has not neglected to doe that every day, which omitted, will be the greateſt cut and grief to our hearts, on <hi>that day,</hi> the great day, when the ways and ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be opened, and all the <hi>prizes,</hi> the opportunities put-into our hands, let ſlip thence, and loſt there, ſhall be preſented to our knowledge: This will be the <hi>Hell</hi> indeed. Therefore, that this <hi>hope</hi> may not be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit only, but an <hi>Anchor,</hi> ſure and ſtedfaſt, to the ſoul, amidſt the great water-floods, It concernes this man to conſider as followes:</p>
               <p>He has heard the Drumme beate every day theſe three yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; It was his <hi>Alarm;</hi> he was called upon to put himſelfe in a <hi>poſture of Defence;</hi> for when the houre of temptation and ſore agony comes upon him (it is come upon the world) and he be found <hi>naked,</hi> he muſt be <hi>left</hi> the more <hi>naked</hi> of excuſe, becauſe he was called-upon every day to maintaine his <hi>Militia,</hi> to quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as a good ſouldier of Jeſus Chriſt: He muſt think alſo, if he thinks of himſelf, and common reaſon forſakes him not, (which muſt needs tell him,) That ſooner or later he ſhall meet with enemies e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to combate with, though none of thoſe deſtroyers, (ſo buſily employed now in working-out their own deſtruction, and againſt their intent, the ſalvation of Gods people) though none of theſe, he meet with, yet he muſt looke to meet with thoſe as bad to combate with, with the <hi>Prince</hi> ruling in the ayre, <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> thoſe mighty adverſaries, might and power it ſelfe; Beſides, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement <hi>winds,</hi> and a ſcorching <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> will <hi>beat upon the head</hi> of every man ſooner or later, and down he falls, he knowes not how low, unleſſe his ſtanding be ſure upon the <hi>Rock,</hi> in a good poſture of Defence; when a ſickneſſe unto death comes, then this will be,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:130910:8"/> even the ſenſe of all this, if the heart be not, at that time, as <hi>Naballs</hi> was, <hi>like a ſtone,</hi> dead and <hi>paſt feeling;</hi> Before the man dies; then, I ſay, the ſenſe of all this will be; The man may be now like a <hi>wild-Aſſe</hi> traverſing his way, but in that <hi>Moneth</hi> he ſhall be <note place="margin">Jer. 2. 24.</note> found.</p>
               <p>But before this day comes, who knows what terrible things he may ſee! He may ſee the tearing-up of mountaines by the rootes, and hurling them into the midſt of the ſea, as the Prophet expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">Pſal. 46.</note> the terrible commotions, concuſſions, diſtractions, which have been, are and will be in poſturing times, <hi>troublous times</hi> ever, when the breaches in <hi>Jeruſalems wall</hi> are making-up; He may feele the earth trembling, Divells and men raging, garments rouled in blood; he may ſee Townes fired; Cities laid-waſt; all <hi>deſireable things</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and what his ſoul loaths given into his hands, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead thereof. Then, if he hath maintained his <hi>Militia,</hi> if he be, as the good ſouldier, in a poſture of defence, happy is he. If otherwiſe, neither he nor I can expreſſe how miſerable his caſe will be; very miſerable and beyond expreſſion. <hi>Sinners in Zion,</hi> men profeſſing the truth, but not ſhewing forth the power thereof in their life, theſe ſhall be afraid, fearfullneſſe and trembling will come upon him, ſorrow will overwhelme him; The proud waters will goe over <note place="margin">Pſal. 55. 5.</note> his head; terrours ſhall make him afraid on every ſide; brimſtone ſhall be ſcattered upon his habitation. <note place="margin">Job 18. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>There is one thing more in this, and commands our ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. Suppoſe this careleſſe perſon ſhould be inſtrumentall to the poſturing the Kingdome, in throwing out Perſons and Things, which have troubled the peace of the ſame; Suppoſe ſo, while yet he himſelfe is an unreformed perſon, his own <hi>Militia</hi> is quite neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; Then this will follow, That all this he has done, though ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the command of <hi>God,</hi> is upon his ſcore, and he ſhall be reckoned with for it, even for the good, he hath done, becauſe after an ill manner. He (as was ſaid of old) <hi>rebuked pride with another pride;</hi> he has throwne-out Idoll-Perſons, and their Idoll ſervices, but is as Idolatrous as were they: They ſet-up Idolls before their eyes, he ſetts-them up in his heart: It was <hi>Jehues</hi> caſe, a moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table caſe; He deſtroyed <hi>Ahab</hi> and his houſe, and had a word for it, the command of <hi>God,</hi> But he did it for the glory of his own name; with a zeale burning-hot, but it was for his own houſe, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:130910:8"/> was ſuch an Idolater, as <hi>Ahab</hi> was: Therefore ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> (it is terrible) <hi>I will avengeth blood of</hi> Jezreel <hi>upon the houſe of</hi> Jehu. This Scripture is fully and uſefully cleared to me and thee, (for <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Burrought</hi> upon <hi>Hoſea,</hi> c. i. v. 4.</note> there is a deceit in Generalls) how dangerous a thing it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſelves teachers of others, and yet not teach our ſelves; A reformer of others, and yet our ſelves unreformed; An enemy to Idols ſtanding without the man, but a friend to Idols ſtanding-up in his own heart: This is to abhorre Idols, yet to commit ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It is of great, of infinite concernment. Let me ſpeake this over once more to the <hi>Gallio</hi> of theſe times, I would ſingle him out though he is plurall; I meane them, whoſe hearts, and hands may be with the Parliament, but they regard the things that are done, no more than <hi>Gallio did the beating of Soſthenes;</hi> To this man I <note place="margin">Acts 18. 17.</note> would point theſe few words. 1. He can think it very fit that all that which exalts it ſelfe in a Kingdome, to the deſtruction of King and Kingdome, be taken downe; the <hi>Idols</hi> there throwne away, for they make a Kingdome <hi>naked;</hi> and he can be active this way; But he heares not himſelfe ſpeak all this while unto himſelfe, That it more concernes him to throw-out the Idols all, which exalt themſelves in his own heart againſt the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> and his own peace. 2. He can, perhaps, command <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Fasting</hi> alſo, think all this ſeaſonable in theſe <hi>troublous times;</hi> but regards not how ſlack and cold he is at that performance in his houſe and cloſſet. 3. So for the <hi>word</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>GOD</hi> unto ſalvation, he can help to widen the doore, to give it a free paſſage, and yet ſhut his own heart againſt it, not ſubjecting himſelfe to the <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>power</hi> thereof. 4. So for the <hi>Lords day;</hi> he has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps helped to vindicate that day from its horrible pollutions, and yet the duties performed on that day, <hi>what a wearineſſe to him?</hi> 5. So for the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he can perſwade others to enter-into it, and yet not perſwaded in his own heart, <hi>to ſtand unto it,</hi> though he has lifted-up his hand to the high GOD, and ſubſcribed his name, that ſo he will doe. He complaines of the <hi>publick</hi> miſeries, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are the <hi>private,</hi> that trouble him <note n="*" place="margin">

               </argument>
               <p>I Muſt review the compariſon betwixt the Civill Body and the Naturall: In this, there were malignant humours as evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; In that, there are malignant Perſons and Things. Malignant Perſons, I will but name the chiefe, ſpecially thoſe, who have De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed the Land with blood; polluted it with Idolatries; leavened it with Atheiſme and prophaneneſſe; All theſe might be pointed at with the finger. 1. The murtherers firſt, <hi>men of bloods,</hi> mighty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the LORD, who have ſlaine the bodies of men; ſpilt their pretious blood like water. God will require it; <hi>At the hand of every beast will GOD require it</hi>

               <p>Theſe are, I know not how many, but I will gather them-up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to as ſhort a ſumme as I can. 1.

                  <hi>Ships</hi> alſo, and to <hi>dayes,</hi> which we call <hi>holy:</hi> So we ſhould not doe, for we have but one <hi>Holy-day,</hi> and that is the <hi>LORDS Day;</hi> Other dayes there are, <hi>good dayes</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Eſth. 9. 22.</note> dayes of praiſe and thankſgiving: and dayes of attonement, <hi>Faſting dayes,</hi> ſoule afflicting dayes: As for holy dayes, we know not where to find them, unleſſe in <hi>Romes</hi> Calender: and if we have them thence, then ſure we muſt caſt them-out of ours: And greater reaſon yet, why it ſhould be ſo; Becauſe old <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid long ſince, <q rend="inline"> The Devill has more ſervice done him upon one holy day, then he has on ten working dayes.</q> The ſtrongeſt plea for keeping in theſe dayes is, <q rend="inline">

                  </q> Yes, but let them not be called holy dayes. There ſhall be fit times appointed, wherein children and ſervants, yea and maſters too, may take <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>fitting</hi> recreations; [I meane by <hi>meet,</hi> ſuch as are recreations indeed; truly ſo called, comely for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſuch as will indeed make them <hi>fit for warre:]</hi> But when we have ſaid all, or enough touching this grant or allowance, for <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full recreations,</hi> and fit times for them, yet <hi>holy dayes,</hi> as we ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:130910:10"/> or wickedly call them, ſhall be caſt-out, when all is done. 4. <hi>Bookes</hi> next (for ſo ſome miſ-call them) thoſe accurſed things, ſo filled-up with blaſphemies, hereſies; ſuch in-lets to atheiſme and prophaneneſſe, making roomth for <hi>Rome,</hi> and bringing-in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſalem;</hi> Theſe ſhall be caſt-out. To name the laſt firſt, Bookes (as they call them) which deny, that the Law of GOD has any <hi>coercive,</hi> or binding power; Man is a lawleſſe creature now; let him doe what he has a will to doe, <hi>GOD ſees him not;</hi> Though it be ſaid every where, <hi>they did evill in GODS ſight,</hi> yet <hi>GOD ſees no ſinne in His children.</hi> What Booke ſhall we heare of next? We need not queſtion it; A Booke <hi>denying the immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſoule,</hi> or affirming, <hi>That the ſoul does ſleepe with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:</hi> I could tell the Reader how an Heathens booke was ſerved, who had written but doubtfully touching ſuch a matter; It is high time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I know my place and ſtation.</p>
               <p>I might be large here, and yet ſay little, becauſe vile, treacherous and prophane <hi>Perſons</hi> are ſo many; and Things, defiling and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to a Nation, are, as many; Therefore, if I ſhould ſay more, yet. I ſhould not ſay the halfe; The halfe! when we ſhall heare what the <hi>Good Souldier</hi> will ſay, who will give us the life and uſe of all this, and ſpeake all he knowes faithfully touching his own heart, the <hi>Malignant lords</hi> there, (for every luſt there, not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is a lord there:) And Things, yet he cannot ſpeake the <hi>halfe</hi> of that evill, or malignancy, he finds within himſelfe, his own heart; A great part whereof he never knew; A great part of it, and of the evill therein, is to him as the <hi>terra incognita</hi> to us, There is a ſpace left for it in our <hi>Maps:</hi> So is there a <hi>prayer</hi> put-up by this man every day, for pardon of that <hi>evill,</hi> which he diſcernes not, but he knowes it is there. Therefore ſith it will be upon confeſſion anon, That there is more <hi>evill</hi> in one mans heart, than he can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly take notice of; I forbeare to name any more <hi>Perſons</hi> or Things, which are to be found in a Kingdome, That I may take the more time to ſatisfie the Reader touching this objection, <hi>What is done againſt all theſe malignants,</hi> that are knowne, and diſcovered, for the cutting them off, or caſting-them forth of the Kingdome, that our Kingdome may be the <hi>LORDS Kingdome;</hi> that He may come-in and delight amongſt us? thus now, the objections runs-on.</p>

The firſt obſervation is;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our enquities, buſie and over-haſty thoughts, and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cares, about <hi>Reformation</hi> (the well Poſturing a Kingdome, The time when it will be) are moſt vaine, and diſquieting to no purpoſe.

And impoſſible it is, that <hi>a Reformation, a child of ſo many Prayers and Teares,</hi> (the Prayers of all the faithfull, that are or have been in the world,) That a child of ſo many Prayers (as was ſaid of <hi>Austin</hi> unto his mother) <hi>ſhould periſh;</hi> Periſh! No, nor ſtick at the birth a minute longer, than as the ſticking-there ſhall make for the exaltation of Gods arme, in the pulling-of it-forth: and the filling-top-full the hearts of His people, with comfort in its <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> after they have ſuffered a little, that is the firſt obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their Excellencies, the chiefe Commanders by Land and Sea; All the Nobles and Worthies of both Kingdomes, (more deare unto us then the blood in our veines) doe march-on under the ſafeſt conduct, which is, <hi>the banner of the LORD spread over their heads by the unceſſant prayers of all the faithfull in the world:</hi> There is not a man, woman or child in the world, that can pray,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:130910:21"/> But they ſay, concerning this <hi>Hoſt of God: We wiſh you proſperity in the name of the Lord:</hi> All the bleſſings in the Booke of <hi>God,</hi>

When the Adverſaries Army failes (that is all fleſh) all failes him; when the creature leaves him, all leaves him, for he cannot pray. But when the arme of fleſh failes the righteous, it is no more, but what they expected, and they cling the faſter to the arme of God, who ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth moſt when the arme of fleſh is leaſt in ſight: When all the creatures are gone, yet God is not gone, nay then he is neareſt, for then <hi>Prayer is</hi>

From theſe premiſes, which we doubt not, but were throughly conſidered on by the truly Noble and highly Honoured now in Parliament, we muſt conclude, Firſt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the darke places of the earth are now as they ever have beene, <hi>full of cruelty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

More might be added here, but I paſſe on, and conclude.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Arch-biſhops and Biſhops tooke the readieſt way that could be taken, to bring an Egyptian darkneſſe all over the Land: For 1.

They taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by their own example; I ſay, by their own example, to make gods, and then to worſhip before them: and that was the only way to make a people, as now they are, as bruitiſh as ſtocks: and as fierce as Lyons. I ſay nothing here how they did blaſpheme the Lord and his day; I conclude.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That there is not a man, I ſay not a man, that has <hi>heartily</hi> joyned himſelfe to the Kings Army, who has not received the <hi>marke of the beaſt</hi> either openly in his forehead, or ſecretly in his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:130910:30"/> hand; or he has <hi>damnation</hi> written in his forehead: not a man in the Kings Army, <hi>willingly</hi> there, and on that ſide, who is not a <hi>Papist,</hi> or, which is as bad, an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> (that is) bruitiſhly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or notoriouſly profane: So I have liſted that <hi>Legion,</hi> that black Regiment, the Devils guard, under two generall heads, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> all: And when the <hi>Nobles</hi> there ſhall goe about to <hi>recruit</hi> their Army, as ſure as the Devill is in Hell, and his angels, his miniſtring ſervants are on earth; ſo ſure it is, they ſhall not find a man, hearty to their ſervice, not one man in all the Chriſtian world, who is not one of theſe two; one that knowes nothing, as he ought to know, he is a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> or one that is <hi>bruitiſh in knowledge,</hi> and more bruitiſh in practiſe, he is an <hi>Atheiſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That ſhould the Nobles and Worthies have <hi>parlied,</hi> as many yeares as they have weekes, upon a way how to remedy all this, how to make a firme <hi>Peace,</hi> and eſtabliſh <hi>Truth</hi> in the Land, that theſe may <hi>meete</hi> and <hi>kiſſe</hi> each other, they could not have thought of a ſhorter, more compendious, and more ready way, than that they have taken. And ſo now I muſt returne back againe, that I may traverſe the <hi>way</hi> the Worthies of the LORD have taken from the firſt day they ſate in Parliament upward to this day: The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt reader ſhall then more clearely underſtand, the changes and tydes of things as they <hi>are at this day:</hi> and be able more than by conjecture to tell what ſhall be in after-dayes.

Refuſed to maintaine the <hi>Diadem</hi> and <hi>Crowne</hi> of three Kingdomes! Refuſed to ſtand-faſt in the liberty wherein God and man had ſet them! Ah Lord! Indeed it is to be pittied, but not to be wondred at, if we conſider the <hi>places</hi> where theſe people live; The Teaching they had there; and the influence that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had into the hearts and lives of men all over the land. I pray you let us conſider, The place firſt, where lived they?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Under the droppings or near about Cathedrals. It is as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous a word as the people are who live there: yet we now know what the Cathedrals are, The <hi>Biſhops Churches, and the Devils Chappels:</hi> There <hi>the Biſhop had his ſeat,</hi> and <hi>Satan has his throne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What <hi>teaching</hi> had they there, under thoſe droppings, or near there abouts? what teaching there? None at all, no catechiſing, no inſtruction there: A Sermon perhaps there was, ſuch as it was, which nouriſhed no more than <hi>nuts</hi> doe, which fill with wind: or <note place="margin">Clem. Alex.</note> than Stock-fiſh does, which, <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſayes, nouriſheth no more than does a ſtone. And for the places further off whereinto their Prebends there had an influence, The people were not taught at all; not that there was any <hi>Spirit</hi> good or bad, or that the people had any other ſoules, than what the beaſts have. True it is, and not to bely the Devill, The Doctour told the people, when he came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Eaſter book, and gather in his Tythes, That there is a God, and they muſt ſerve Him; A Devill too, and they muſt fly from him, and hate his workes: for a <hi>heaven</hi> there is, and everlaſting Joyes there; And <hi>hell</hi> there is, and eternall paines there. But the people beleeved none of all this. That was their fault, you will ſay. Indeed it was. But the Doctour was foully to blame: Becauſe, what he taught with the mouth once or twiſe a yeare, he untaught with his hands every day: for no ſooner preached he the preaching, his owne heart ſuggeſted to him, but away from the Church to the Ale-houſe, where he would drinke like a ſwine; or if not given to that ſin, (as all are not) yet to another as bad; Beſides all this, he would earth himſelfe in the earth; hunt after honours, ride after preferments furiouſly, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did; drowne himſelfe in the world, as if he knew no other God, as certainly he does not. And
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:130910:31"/> this ſpoiled all his Philoſophy to the people; he, that told them there is a God, and then turned his back upon Him, could they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him?

A mercy given too ſoone, when we would have it, proves a judgement after ward. A calme is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanteſt after a ſtorme: ſo is peace, uſhered-in with warre, as this peace muſt be: For I am miſtaken quite in the booke of God, and in our booke of Dayes, Chronicles and Hiſtories of the Church, if a ſore brunt and great <hi>fight of afflictions</hi> be not yet behind: That wicked woman, the <hi>Jezabell</hi> of theſe laſt dayes, was long in riſing, by ſtepps and degrees to her height and <hi>zenith</hi> of her glory: She is now fallen from thence, and ſhe falls apace, yet, by ſtepps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, not yet as a milſtone: She has received a blow, an aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing blow on her forehead, and yet the blow, hitting not ſo right, ſhe has broken looſe, as we know an Oxe has done, and is mad with rage: the next blow will ſtrike her at once downe to the ground, <note place="margin">Booke of Martyrs.</note> ſhe ſhall not need a ſecond blow; but like a beaſt, whoſe throate is cut, ſhe will ſtruggle for life. All this aſſures us, we muſt expect no peace yet, unleſſe ſuch a peace, which the men of the world give, and that the ſonnes and daughters of God abominate, even all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and aſſayes that way.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:130910:36"/> ſay, <hi>at laſt,</hi> for at its firſt comming to the heart, it finds all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that the heart can make againſt it; And ſtirres and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults there will be within this <hi>little kingdome,</hi> within the mans breaſt: for there are Idols there, which muſt be caſt-out; and he that is called a <hi>ſtrong man,</hi> muſt be overcome, and his goods ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; which ſhall be at <hi>the laſt.</hi> At firſt entrance, there will be an hot contention, <hi>stirres</hi> and <hi>tumults,</hi> as was ſaid, even theſe within that little kingdome, the mans own breaſt. And if ſo in that little kingdome, we need not propheſie (for we ſee it fulfilled before our eyes,) what ſtirres, tumults, oppoſitions, perſecutions muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected now, through all the Lords Kingdomes, now that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are gone forth with the <hi>everlaſting Gospell:</hi> Now that the <hi>Mountaine of the LORDS</hi> houſe muſt be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountaines, and muſt be exalted above the hills; now expect <hi>fier</hi> and <hi>ſword,</hi> all the oppoſition, that Hell gates, the Devill and his angels by force and fraud can make againſt theſe Angels, who are carrying forth the <hi>everlaſting Goſpell;</hi> and ſaying with a loud voice, <hi>feare God, &amp;c.</hi> Now the Nations are angry, the wicked gnaw their tongues; we muſt expect from theſe Nations, theſe Heathen, bruitiſh people, as from an angry people, men mad upon their Idols, and with rage, nothing but <hi>fier and ſword;</hi> Therefore muſt all, that love the Goſpell, the Nation, and their own lives, all theſe muſt <hi>learne warre</hi> now; they muſt <hi>beat their plowſhares into ſwords, and their pruning-hookes into speares;</hi> for never was it known, if you aske from one end of the Heaven to the other, <note place="margin">You never read of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when there was ſuch a deformation all over the Church and State.</note> That the Angels lifted-up their voice, ſaying, <hi>feare God, &amp;c.</hi> and the angry Nations did not lift-up the ſword at the ſame time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Angels: That the Angels preached the Goſpell of Peace, and the Heathen people, yea and men civilized, profeſſing the truth, but denying the <hi>power,</hi> did not learne to warre againſt it at that very time. Will theſe Angels expect better welcome from the world than their Maſter had, the Angell of the Covenant? No ſooner opened He His mouth to preach, but the people opened their mouth againſt Him, and reached forth their hand to caſt Him downe headlong from the edge of the hill: He would teach them, they would perſecute Him, with the tongue and hand both. His Apoſtles, <hi>(men ſent forth to preach,</hi>) fared no better, not one of them: But their bruitiſh dealing with <hi>Paul</hi> is moſt notorious,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:130910:36"/> we never read or ſaw the like untill this very day, Ile but point to it. It muſt be ſo, and ſo it muſt be expected; Theſe Angels, like <hi>Paul</hi>

We cannot think now, that ſuch turnings <hi>upſide down,</hi> can be without confuſed noiſe; for in this turning, Heaven &amp; earth are brought together. We expect now the downfall of Antichiſt, he muſt fall, he muſt fall down, down like a milſtone into the great waters, how great will that fall be! There will be a great noiſe ſure, for all the ſhoulders in earth and in Hell, are conjoyned to ſupport and hold-up <hi>Babylon:</hi> When all theſe ſhoulders ſhall crack and its pillars be broken to pieces like earthen veſſels; there will be a great noiſe ſure! We underſtand by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the prophecy is fulfilling now, when the <hi>mountaine of the LORDS houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed on the top of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and exalted above the hills;</hi> Now the Devill and his angels, the <hi>mountaines</hi> and the <hi>hills,</hi> the Kings and Rulers on the earth will bend all their force to hinder the accompliſhment of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, which does aſſure us, that theſe <hi>mountaines</hi> and <hi>hills</hi> ſhall now be made plaines, therefore the <hi>gates of Hell</hi> ſtand wide open now to oppoſe the exaltation of Chriſts Kingdome; A mighty oppoſition, and a confuſed noiſe will be now, the ruſhing of Nations as of mighty waters will be heard now.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Why now? does the preaching of the Goſpell, or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that preach it, cauſe this confuſed noiſe, ſore paine, and trouble to the inhabitants of the earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>B.</hi> Yes that it does, by <hi>accident,</hi> as ſchollers ſay; As the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beames cauſe the poiſon in a ſerpent to appeare, &amp; drawes forth its malignancy; The Sun puts no poiſon there, but finds it there, draws it forth, and actuates the ſame. You may, for farther illuſtration, compare the malignant-Lords and Rulers of the world to a <hi>dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill;</hi> (to that ſtinking place, the beſt men of the world have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their own hearts, to a dunghill) The Sun puts no filthy ſent there, nor are the Sun-beames impured or defiled by ſhining there,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:130910:37"/> (nothing can defile the Sun-beames) but the Sun-beames upon the dunghill drawes forth a filthy ſavour thence, makes it reak there: ſo the ſetting-up the Lord Chriſt upon His holy hill, does not put any rage, envy or malice into the hearts of His adverſaries, the Princes of the earth and Rulers there; no, all this is in the heart before, as in its proper place; but now it is quickned, and actuated by the brightneſſe of His comming, as the poiſon in the ſerpent, or as the filth in a dunghill by the heat of the Sun, and cleareneſſe of his beames. The maine intendment of the Goſpell, and of thoſe, that preach it, is, to <hi>cauſe peace</hi> to the earth. But there is much bloodſhed there, which the earth has drunk-in, and this muſt be diſcovered, yea and required alſo: There are many Idols there, thoſe muſt be caſt forth as abominable things, and that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the troubles, ſhakings of Kingdomes, and earthquakes <hi>as at this day;</hi> And indeed the Nations muſt be ſhaken, before the <hi>Lord Chriſt can be the deſire of the Nations.</hi> And this is the power of <note place="margin">Hag. 2. 7.</note> the Goſpell, or the Goſpell preached with power, <hi>to ſhake the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> terribly, to make the earth tremble.

               <p>

So that the Lord could no longer beare, becauſe of the evill of our doings, and the abominations, which we have committed? So it may be ſaid to us, therefore the ſword devoureth as at this day; our abominable Idols ſet-up before the eye, and kept-up within the heart, our abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſervices unto them, have cauſed all this; and now that the light is come, and has diſcovered all this, ſo that the earth ſhall no longer cover her ſlaine, nor hold faſt her Idols, therefore is the earth-quake.</p>
               <p>And now to ſhut-up this Chapter, with the beſt-counſell, and to

Our Prieſts have committed a great ſacriledge, never the like; The Lord Chriſt reſerved to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but one day, gave us ſix dayes; our Prieſts took from their Lord, that one day, and gave it to the people, that they alſo might plat a garland of May-flowers, and, in ſcorne of their Lord and His day, ſet that garland upon that day: We had ſix dayes, the Biſhops and Curates had <hi>exceeding many Holy-dayes</hi> (the Church can ſpare them every one) yet the Biſhops <hi>spared</hi> to take any one of our ſix dayes, or of their own holy-dayes, though (ſo many) and tooke that <hi>one day,</hi> ſet that ſcorne upon the Lords-day.

               <p>IT is a matter of high conſideration, how exact and accurate the <hi>zelots</hi> in all ages, good Kings and Princes, all have beene touching Temple or Church-matters: Kings gave their attendance and all diligence thereunto: It was their charge they thought, and their honour, we are ſure, to ſee unto it, that all the <hi>filthineſſe</hi> was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the Temple, every thing provoking in Gods ſight remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: that the veſſels there, even thoſe be cleanſed; the <hi>Prieſts</hi>

                  <note n="a" place="margin">Reade 2 Chr. chap. 29. &amp; 30. chap. 34, 35. 1 Joh. 2. 16.</note>. It is enough to point at theſe things, and now to ſhew in a few words (in ſo cleare a caſe) how all this relates to us, and is written to provoke them to give all diligence, and to be zealous, whom the LORD has ſet as <hi>over-ſeers</hi> in ſuch high matters. Ile only ſet down briefly, how it has been; They, whom it does concerne, and are aſſembled together for that high end, will conſider how it ought to be.</p>
               <p>Next to the <hi>LORDS Day,</hi> nothing has been more prophaned, than have the <hi>LORDS</hi> Sacraments, <hi>ſeales of the righteouſneſſe of Faith.</hi> The Sacrament of Baptiſme has been adminiſtred by <hi>ſons of Belial,</hi> who <hi>knew not the LORD:</hi> And to thoſe children, whoſe Parents, both father and mother, were openly prophane, made no acknowledgement thereof, neither cared, nor could, nor would give a reaſon of their faith, <hi>or hope that is in them:</hi> I will only adde this to be enquired into, whether a Parent; preſenting his child to the Sacrament, is not to give firſt an account of his faith, and reaſon of his hope, that is in him, and of his intereſt to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? Certaine it is, that, if the Parent were ſo to doe, he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelfe and his child before the Lord and His people in a more ſolemne manner, and with more conſideration. We all know how queſtions have been anſwered, and matters ſlubbered over, <hi>I FORSAKE THEM ALL;</hi> What doe you forſake? All, that is in the world, <hi>the luſts of the fleſh; the lusts of the eye; and the pride of life.</hi> The <hi>Good LORD</hi> pardon His ſervants, we have ſpoken, we know not how often, very unadviſedly with our lipps; When we ſaid <hi>we forſake them all;</hi> we forſook nothing at all; Even at that ſolemne time, and before the Congregation, there was nothing in ſight, but the <hi>luſts of the eye;</hi> and <hi>pride of life.</hi> We ſlubbered over, with our <hi>Parſons</hi> helpe, another queſtion as unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly, as the former, and made anſwer thereunto; <hi>ALL THIS I STED FASTLY BELEEVE;</hi> All what? That, though the Miniſter can but ſprinckle water upon the child, he can neither cleanſe the water, nor can the water cleanſe the child, yet the LORD CHRIST has done both, and her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </argument>
               <p>WE have ſeen with our eyes, that the ſervants of the Lord working <hi>with God this Day</hi> have wrought as great a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for the Kingdomes, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> for Iſrael: We have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the <hi>way</hi> (it is but one and the ſame) they went-in, the very
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:130910:48"/> ſteps and degrees of their happy proceedings. And now we are come to the higheſt ſtep, the entring Covenant with the high God, which <hi>containes much,</hi> nay, all the forementioned, for all that went before, has a direct tendencie hereunto, as to its end, next to the <hi>glory of GOD;</hi> The engaging the heart of a Kingdome as one man, unto one God; The intereſting, intitling Him to the kingdome, the giving-up the Government of it into Gods Hands, which is the way to make a Kingdome ſo ſtrong, ſo well fortified, that all the devils in hell, with thoſe in the Ayre, and all their ſworn ſervants on earth can have no power againſt this Kingdome now to doe it hurt; though they rage againſt it, and, to their power gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them, doe <hi>ſtorme</hi> it, yet they cannot hurt it: for the kingdome is brought-up to God; the Government yeelded-up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to His hands; He will looke to His owne. But I was ſaying, as this covenanting with God was the <hi>End,</hi> and tendency of all that went before, ſo this containes the meanes, and perfects them; I meane thus, The firſt ſtep towards this work was the caſting forth the accurſed Perſons and things; theſe will returne againe; the heart of the kingdome will deale with theſe, as Iſrael of old dealt <note place="margin">Jer. 34. 11.</note> with their ſervants when the ſiege was removed, they will take them-in again: But now the Kingdome has covenanted againſt theſe, they have ſworne to maintaine war againſt them, and their encroachings, they will never ſerve dumb idols any more, thus they have <hi>covenanted;</hi> No peace with themſelves any more, ſo far as <hi>ſelfe</hi> is its ſelfe; no peace with Rome any more, or her idols, no peace with any thing that makes roomth for <hi>ſuperſtition, hereſie, prophaneneſſe;</hi> no peace with any of theſe any more, as a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome lookes to maintaine their ſtanding, and peace with God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Then ſome other Miniſters in the places adjoyning tell the poore people, that their Miniſters were quite miſtaken, they aſſure them that all the lawes of God and man, the law of Nature and of Nations doe allow them their ſword, wherewith to fence their throats, and maintaine their lives; and, if to maintaine <hi>life,</hi> then much more to maintaine their <hi>Religion,</hi> which is more than life: ſo the poore people were reſolved. But they would, as before they had done, deale with their <hi>Lord of Trinity</hi> (it is not pertinent to give you the reaſon of the name) by petitions, and ſupplications, deſiring only that they might hold-faſt their God, and keep faſt to their Religion: for that is the way to keepe God with them: It would not be granted, no anſwer could they heare: but, <hi>To the fire with them</hi>

               <p n="3">3.

Bleſſed be God, who does check our vain hopes for excellent purpoſes, to wind-up our hearts to Him; Indeed we doe, what in us lies, to break our own Arme to pieces, by laying ſtrength upon it, which it cannot bear, and not upon Him, who is Mightie: while we are ſo conceited of the Creature, that it can doe ſo much, God can doe nothing; But the Lord we hope has taught us now to look-up to Him, and there to reſt, in expectation of all from Him; And now that we can doe ſo, we can aſſure our ſelves, that the LORD will uſe His pretious ſervants in the North, and every where, and doe great <hi>things (exploits)</hi> by their hands, for which His ſervants will give Him the glory; they know the cauſe is His, the Kingdomes His, the People His by Covenant; the Lord will work like a God now, as alwayes He has done, for a people in covenant with Him. <hi>Amen.</hi>

A great deale; no one man in the world more than he, becauſe he is ſo much at home, and where ever he is, communing ſtill with his own heart; he is a great enemie to GODS enemies, the rebels now in the Land: But a greater enemie, if greater may be, to the Rebellion in his own heart, or that he meets with from thoſe God has made him Ruler over, and chiefe Over-ſeer; The Rebellion there vexeth him moſt, for that, he knowes, grieveth the Spirit of his God moſt of all.

If a Mans ſpirit be not moſt lifted-up with indignation againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions in his own heart, whether thoughts or idols there; his boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings are vaine, and his attempts likely to be as vaine, touching the caſting-forth the Rebels out of the land. This is the way this good Souldier takes, his complaints are moſt againſt the rebellions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doores; and as his chiefe hatred is againſt them, ſo alſo his chiefe hatred, and <hi>firſt-borne of his ſtrength</hi> is againſt this or that, which is an offence to his <hi>GOD,</hi> and to caſt that out, and ſo he becomes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry publike perſon, a good part of the Kingdomes <hi>Militia,</hi> as <hi>the Chariots of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof,</hi> as was ſaid.

The Parliament have put-to all their ſhoulders to exalt the Lord Chriſt upon His Throne in heaven (the Church:) and to ſet their King upon his His Throne on earth: never any Parliament have done like them, for they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured their utmoſt to take away the wicked from before the King, <note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 25. 5.</note> to hold and to keep him in the Throne of God, that he might be a King for God, rule for Him, doe Juſtice and Judgement to all His people; and ſo to ſettle a <hi>Right Scepter</hi> in His hand, and <note place="margin">Pſal. 45. 6.</note> a Crowne upon his head, that it might ſtand faſt there, till the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, and then but exchange it neither, a crowne of earth for a crowne of glory; And in ſo doing they have ſaid to their King Indeed and in Truth, <hi>O King live for ever; the eternall GOD bee thy Refuge, and underneath the everlasting Armes; Thruſt out the enemies from before thee, and deſtroy them:</hi> Thus have the Parliament wrought, and endeavoured for their King; God, Angels and men are witneſſes of this, the Parliament call all theſe to record with them touching this matter.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:130910:65"/> Lord Chriſt Himſelfe; He came amongſt His owne, they received Him not; He wrought wonders amongſt them, they regarded them not; He would have made them free-men, they would not, they were free already, nor did they ſo much as thank Him; how high their wrath reached we all know: And that they quitted <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabas</hi> and condemned <hi>Jeſus;</hi> there is nothing <hi>now</hi> that is <hi>new,</hi> I can give but an hint only, and more needs not. 2.

None of theſe things this man is now robbed of could yeeld him any comfort but from an <hi>influence,</hi> through them, from Heaven; This <hi>influence,</hi> the adverſaries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtop no more than they can bind the ſweet influences of the Pleiades or Sun beames; what comforts he had before from hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, lands, friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſame the Lord now inſtills immediately from himſelfe: and the immediate comforts are the ſtrongeſt comforts.</p>

                     <hi>a Devill.</hi> Indeed this man glorieth very much in this, that he is as his Maſter was, ſo reproached, ſo perſecuted, ſo blaſpemed. What ſayes he now in way of anſwer to theſe blaſphemies? Nothing, he ſpreads this blaſphemy, as the King the <hi>letter, before the LORD;</hi> His Lord ſhall anſwer it, and ſo He will; He will anſwer it by Himſelfe: for God is blaſphemed, and not the man; His grace, His image upon the man, His actings in the man to and for his God; that, that is it, the <hi>butt</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> at which malice bends her bow, and ſhootes her arrowes, even devouring words: God muſt anſwer this by Himſelfe, for He is blaſphemed, the man will ſay nothing. The reproach is againſt his LORD and <hi>Maſter,</hi> He will require it; if there were nothing of <hi>GOD</hi> in the man, no more than is in his adverſaries, they could agree very well, for then <hi>Rebels</hi> and <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi> all, and no offence at all; but God and godlineſſe in the man, there is the <hi>butt</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> God will anſwer it. And now the man will ſit down and mourne for theſe his adverſaries in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
